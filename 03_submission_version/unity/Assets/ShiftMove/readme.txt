Hello! Thank you for downloading!

To start using plugin just import .dll file to your project and place it to folder named 'editor'. 
Now you can select objects, hold shift (command for mac), move mouse and clone them.
For more details see 'manual.pdf'

Please, do not forget to write a review if you like it!
